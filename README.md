# Sign-up-form
TOP intermediate HTML and CSS project.

Project from the Intermediate HTML and CSS, showcasing HTML and CSS forms and form styling, as well as using some intermediate styling and positiioning. 

- What worked well?
  
    - Splitting up the page into required 'sections' using previous experience on this from the flex project.
    - Building the 'scaffolding' of the page first, then working on each section at a time, created a good workflow and allowed to exercise specific learnings and 'deep-dive' into any areas that I was not fully confident on and needed confirmation.
    - Including variety of input types and their relevant attributes to fit the assignment checklist.
    - It was really helpful to sketch out an initial plan and think about the 'sections' of the page, which made it easier to plan and break down the workload. 

- What would you do differently?
    - Not sure if the norm, but still finding myself having to 'play around' with padding and margins on each section, to make sure they are aligned, feels like there is a more efficient way to achieve this. With that said the desired outcome has still been achieved.
    - I struggled a bit with styling some parts of the form, like the 'live-feedback' on password, though I imagine this will be easier when done properly using Javascript.
    - I was focusing on a layout specifically for the size similar to the image, but this was not the standard device (neither desktop nor mobile) size, so layout was not quite as expected when somoene opens the page at a glance from either phone or mobile. Next time I'll focus on using a desktop size screen as a default.
    - Definitely still struggling with image and the layout/scaling to fit the area/finding an image of more appropriate size, though through this I did encounter the 'scale' attribute which I've not heard of before, so was good learning. 

- How will you change the way you approach things?
    - I will continue to sketch out an initial plan and think about the sections/moving parts as well as including areas which i feel i may need to reasearch/read up on, before diving into coding.
    - I will make sure to pick out an image with more appropriate sizing/ learn some more about scaling and making the image fit within the allocated space.
    - I would also like to get some more practice on positioning of elements, as it seems like a very handy aspect, so would be great to play around with different position attribute values.
